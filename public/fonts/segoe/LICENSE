Licenses for regular Web fonts

Available in "Pay as you go" or "Pay once" models
Web fonts are licensed for use on websites in accordance with the conditions of the CSS@font face declaration. The Web fonts that can be acquired from Linotype.com are supported by all major browsers, including Firefox 3.5+, IE 5+,Opera 10+, Chrome 4+, Safari 3.1+, iOS Mobile Safari, Android 2.2+ and BlackBerry OS 6.

PayAsYouGo
The cost of a license is determined by the number of times your pages are viewed; there is no time limit with regard to the duration of such a license. You actually purchase a certain quota of page views that you use up over time. We will inform you in good time before your page view quota is exhausted so that you can acquire a new page view quota.
All of our original libraries (Linotype Originals, Platinum Collection, FontFont, Monotype Library, ITC Library, Bitstream and Ascender) are available for purchase using the pay as you go model.

PAYONCE
The pay once license is not time-restructured and you need to pay only once, without additional charges. If your site has more traffic than expected, you should again count the number of additional page views that you expect.
You can purchase many web fonts from our partner foundries in the Pay Once model.
